# Kubic IQ - üõ†Ô∏è Project Overview

We‚Äôre building an SAT prep web app MVP with React (frontend) and Node.js/Express (backend), using existing HTML/CSS from `ca-page-sources` and design assets from `branding` folder. Key backend logic includes user account management, admin panel, and a TrueSkill/Elo-based adaptive mastery system.

# üìÅ Project Structure

- `/ca-page-sources/` ‚Äì Contains HTML & CSS from Coaching Actuaries (use for components/layout)
- `/branding/` ‚Äì Colors, fonts, logos for theming
- `src/` ‚Äì React frontend code
- `server/` ‚Äì Node.js Express backend
- `db/` ‚Äì Schema definitions, migrations, seed files

# 1. Authentication & Account Management

- **User signup/login/logout** with JWT or session cookies
- **User model**: id, email, password hash, display name, TrueSkill Œº, œÉ
- **Admin model**: same auth but admin flag
- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /api/auth/signup` ‚Äì create new users
  - `POST /api/auth/login` ‚Äì return token
  - `GET /api/auth/me` ‚Äì returns current user profile
- In React: create login & register forms, integrate auth context/provider, protect private routes

# 2. Admin Dashboard

- Admin login with same auth flow
- React admin panel: add/remove questions, view question Œº/œÉ, override values
- API:
  - `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/admin/questions`

# 3. TrueSkill Algorithm Implementation

- Use a Node.js TrueSkill library (e.g., `node-trueskill`)
- Define question model: id, content, Œº, œÉ, metadata
- When a student answers:
  1. Fetch user Œº_u, œÉ_u and question Œº_q, œÉ_q
  2. Use `rate_1vs1(student, question)` or inverse if incorrect
  3. Save updated Œº, œÉ for both student and question
- Compute `masteryScore = Œº_u - 3 * œÉ_u`, store in user record

# 4. Practice Flow & Recommendations

- Student page:
  - Display current mastery score
  - Render question content (adapted via React UI)
  - On submit, POST answer; backend returns updated Œº, œÉ, masteryScore, next question id
  - Frontend loads next question automatically
- Recommendation logic: always pick question where `Œº_q` is within ¬±1 of Œº_u

# 5. Technical Details & Implementation Guidance

- Use Copilot comments like:
  - `// TODO: implement JWT auth using express-jwt`
  - `// TODO: rate question using trueskill.rate_1vs1(...)`
- Leverage `ca-page-sources` HTML for React component structure (`className`)
- Use CSS/variables from `branding` in styled components or CSS modules
- Add backend validation, error handling, and unit tests (example tests: question answer flow, mastery updates)

# ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] User and Admin authentication flows work
- [ ] Questions CRUD works for admin
- [ ] TrueSkill rating correctly updates ratings on student answers
- [ ] MasteryScore computed and shown on dashboard
- [ ] Adaptive question sequencing based on Œº values
- [ ] React UI replicates existing HTML/CSS look and feel

# üß† Tips for Copilot usage

- Start prompts with high‚Äëlevel context blocks showing file structure
- Then narrow down to specific function/component implementation
- Provide example usage signature for each API and React component
- Use `#file` references to active open files for Copilot to pull context
